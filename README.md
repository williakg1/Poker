Poker Project for SIG Developers
This is my Poker Hand Analysts Game. It will start by asking you who the first player is and then the second after hitting enter. Then it will reandomly draw the cards and display
them. Then it will analyze and display what type of hand you have if it is anything besides a High Card hand and then display who the winner is. I am looking forward to talking 
about my code and what i can improve.
